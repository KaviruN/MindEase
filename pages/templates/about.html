            <p class="about__header--content">We created this app as a fun project and a learning experience. At first, we didnâ€™t have a clear direction, but as we worked on it, we realized how important mental health is. This journey has been as much about exploring our ideas as it has been about improving our skills.

                We're still learning and growing, especially when it comes to web designing, so thank you for your patience and support. This app is our way of combining creativity, purpose, and a bit of fun. We hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed making it!"
